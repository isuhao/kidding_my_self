@brief Implementation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANSAC">RANSAC</a>, a robust statistical model fitting algorithm.

RANSAC can be used for regression over sample data sets, containing a significant percentage of gross errors. The following image shows the result of using RANSAC to fit a linear model over a set of points in the bi-dimensional plane:

\image html ransac-linear-fitting.png

it is a more robust linear fitting than those performed by other common algorithms, such as least squares, because RANSAC can ignore a big amount of erroneous or not corresponding data elements.

The input to the RANSAC algorithm is a set <b><i>S</i></b> of observed data values, or elements, and a parametric model <b><i>M</i></b> which must be fitted to the observations. RANSAC looks randomly for subsets <b><i>s</i></b> &isin; <b><i>S</i></b> of a fixed size <b><i>n</i></b>, which gets a model <b><i>M</i></b> that fits better the whole data set <b><i>S</i></b>.

With each subset <b><i>s</i></b>, a model fitting is performed, obtaining the parameters for the model <b><i>M</i></b> that fit it best to the elements of the subset. If this succeeds, the algorithm counts the number of elements of the set <b><i>S</i></b> that fit with the new model.

After testing a fixed number <b><i>k</i></b> of random subsets, the algorithm stops, and returns the parameters of the model <b><i>M</i></b> that make it fit the most elements of <b><i>S</i></b>.

To create a RANSAC iterator, the class QVRANSAC should be extended, instantiating the Element and Model template parameters with the type or class for the observed data values, and the model, respectively. The following example defines a RANSAC iterator that will fit a line (represented as an object derived from class Line) over a set of points (represented as objects derived from class QPoint):

@code
// We create the class for the fitting model
class Line
    {
    [...]
    public:
        Line()					{ [...] };
        Line(const QPoint, const QPoint)	{ [...] };
        double distance(const QPoint) const	{ return [...]; }
    };

// And a subclass extending class QVRANSAC
class myRANSAC: public QVRANSAC<QPoint, Line>
    {
    private:
        double maximalDistance;

    public:
        myRANSAC(const QList<QPoint> &observedPoints, const double maximalDistance):
            QVRANSAC< QPoint, Line>(2, 10), maximalDistance(maximalDistance)
            {
            foreach(QPoint point, observedPoints)
                addElement(point);
            }

        const bool fit(const QList<QPoint> &testInliers, Line &model)
            {
            model = Line(testInliers.first(), testInliers.last());
            return true;
            };

        const bool test(const Line &model, const QPoint &point)
            { return model.distance(point) < maximalDistance; };
    };

@endcode

The constructor should call QVRANSAC constructor, providing the size of the subsets <b><i>n</i></b>, and the minimum number of points that a model should fit, from the whole set <b><i>S</i></b>, to be considered a valid model. In this case, only 2 points are needed to create a line, and we will require 10 points fitting in the line to consider it a proper line.

Value <i>maximalDistance</i> will be used to establish the maximal distance between a point and a line, to consider that point as fitting in the line.
The parameter <i>observedPoints</i> is the list of observed data values, points in this case. The constructor myRANSAC adds them to the RANSAC search using the function @ref addElement.

Methods @ref fit and @ref test are declared as <i><b>virtual</b></i> in QVRANSAC, and must be implemented for class myRANSAC. Method @ref fit must contain the code to generate a line model from a subset of the observed values <b><i>s</i></b>. Method @ref test must be able to perform element-model fitting test. Once created the RANSAC class, extending class QVRANSAC, the search must be initiated:

@code
[...]
QList<QPoint> observedData;
observedData.append(QPoint(10,20));
observedData.append(QPoint(20,50));
[...]

int maxIterations = 100;
myRANSAC samplerConsensus(observedData, 1.5);
if (samplerConsensus.iterate(maxIterations))
    {
    Line line = samplerConsensus.getBestModel();
    std::cout << "Found regression line." << std::endl;
    }
else
    std::cout << "A line couldn't be fitted to the data, in " << maxIterations << " iterations.";
[...]

@endcode

The @ref iterate method starts a RANSAC search over of a maximum number of random subsets from <b><i>S</i></b>. It returns true when the search is successful, meaning that a line, closer than 1.5 units to at least 10 sample points from the <i>observedData</i> set was found by the algorithm, in exactly 100 tries. Else it will return false.

The maximum number of iterations (aka, number <b><i>k</i></b> of subsets of <i>observedData</i>to test) should be small enough to stop the search if the probability of finding a good fitting subset <b><i>s</i></b> becomes low. It should be established upon the probability that a valid model would fit a random element of the set <b><i>S</i></b>.

@class QVPROSAC qvsampleconsensus.h qvmath/qvsampleconsensus.h
@brief Implementation of PROSAC, an extension to RANSAC (see @ref QVRANSAC)

This class implements PROSAC, a robust statistical model fitting algorithm.

PROSAC is a more sophisticated and efficient version of RANSAC. The latter is described in the documentation of the class @ref QVRANSAC, which is an implementation of that algorithm for the QVision.

PROSAC can handle heuristic information about the probability that a sample data could fit in a valid model. When picking random samples from the observations set, sample data with high heuristic value is more likely to be chosen, increasing the probability of finding a good sample set that would fit into a valid model.

This makes PROSAC to obtain a fitting model generally faster, trying less random subsets than RANSAC. In practice, with an adequate heuristic function for the sample data, PROSAC can be up to 100 times faster than RANSAC.

Usage of the class @ref QVPROSAC is similar to @ref QVRANSAC. The only difference is at the function @ref addElement, which now takes two input parameters: the sample data, and a numeric heuristic value, which will penalize or benefit the sample data at the random selection of the PROSAC algorithm.

The algorithm is programmed to choose with more probability sample data's with a low heuristic value.
